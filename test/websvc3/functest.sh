#   a2 - Update a TaskListDefinition
#   a3 - This search should return 2 matches
#   a4 - Delete it - which means set the FLAGS to make it inactive
#   a5 - Read back TLDID 2, ensure that Name and FLAGS were updated
#   a6 - This search should only return 1 match because TLDID 2 was made inactive
#   a7 - Read back the predefined TaskListDefinition
